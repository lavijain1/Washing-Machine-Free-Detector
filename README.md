## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a **real-time monitoring system** for detecting and displaying the availability of washing machines across multiple floors. The system enhances user convenience by sending notifications when machines become available, allowing users to avoid long waits and improve the operational efficiency of laundry facilities. 

The system uses **ESP32 microcontrollers** integrated with **MPU6050 sensors** to reliably detect machine status, and a mobile app is connected to a server infrastructure to send real-time notifications to users.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Machine Availability Detection:** Detects whether washing machines are in use or available using sensors.
- **Mobile App Notifications:** Sends instant notifications to users when a machine becomes available.
- **Multi-floor Support:** Monitors and displays the status of machines across different floors or laundry rooms.
- **Improved User Convenience:** Reduces waiting time by notifying users as soon as a washing machine is free.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Optimizes the usage of laundry resources by providing real-time data on machine availability.

## System Architecture

### Hardware Components:
- **ESP32 Microcontroller:** The brain of the system, responsible for gathering data from sensors and communicating with the server.
- **MPU6050 Sensor:** Detects the machine's vibration and motion to determine if it is in use or idle.
